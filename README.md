## üåç Domain System

### **How We Organize Components**

The system uses **4 domains** for diagram generation to preserve cross-domain relationships:

#### **`provider`** - Business relationships and organizational structure
- **Core**: partner, referer, intake, center, memberGroup
- **Admin**: farUser, farGroup, farRole, farPermission, dmProfile
- **Programme**: programme, progRole, activityDef, media

#### **`participant`** - User journeys and personal data
- **Core**: member, memberGroup, progMember, activity, programme
- **Tracking**: ssq_stress01, ssq_pain01, ssq_arthritis01, tracker, trackerDef
- **Programme**: progRole, activityDef, media, journal, journalDef, library, guide

#### **`pathway`** - Content structure and flow
- **Core**: programme, progRole, activityDef
- **Content**: media, defaultMediaID, aCuePointActivities, aMediaIDs, guide
- **Flow**: onEndID, aCuePointActivities, aInteract1Activities, etc.

#### **`site`** - Website content and structure
- **Core**: dmNavigation, dmHTML, dmFacts, dmNews, dmInclude
- **Resources**: dmImage, dmFile



**Why 4 domains?** Because real components connect across boundaries. For example, `member` (participant) connects to `partner` (healthcare organization) - these cross-domain relationships are crucial for understanding the complete system.

## üè• Component Familiarization Guide

This section provides detailed descriptions of all components, organized by business function for easy understanding. Each component includes both a **snappy description** (for quick reference) and a **detailed explanation** (for deep understanding).

### **üéØ Participant Management**
**Snappy:** Central participant record connecting individuals to digital therapeutic ecosystem with HCP hierarchy relationships

**Detailed:** The member represents an individual participant in Wellmind Health's digital therapeutic programs. This is the central entity that connects the human participant to the digital treatment ecosystem with personal preferences, progress tracking, and connections to the healthcare provider hierarchy. The member entity serves as the primary participant record, containing personal details, treatment preferences, and critical relationships to the healthcare provider network (partner organizations, member groups, centers, and referrers).

#### **progMember** - Program Enrollment & Progress Tracking
**Snappy:** Active enrollment tracking participant's journey through structured treatment programs with progress monitoring

**Detailed:** progMember represents the active enrollment of a participant in a specific treatment program. This is where the rubber meets the road - where a participant's journey through a structured therapeutic intervention is tracked, measured, and managed. This entity manages enrollment status, progress tracking, completion milestones, and program-specific participant data. It's the operational record that tracks a participant's engagement with a specific treatment pathway.

#### **activity** - Interactive Treatment Steps
**Snappy:** Personalized treatment step instances derived from activityDef templates for participant interaction

**Detailed:** Activities represent the individual interactive steps that participants engage with during their treatment journey. These are derived from activityDef templates but become personalized instances for each participant. Each activity is a participant-specific instance of an activityDef, containing the participant's responses, progress, and interaction data.

```json
{
  "scanSettings": {
    "excludeFiles": ["participant.cfc", "module.cfc"],
    "excludeFolders": ["farcrycms", "social", "aws"]
  }
}
```

### **Generating Configuration from Database**

The `generate_cfc_scan_config.ps1` script automatically generates the `cfc_scan_config.json` file by:

1. **Analyzing the database structure** from `config/dbdump.sql`
2. **Scanning folder locations** to find CFC files in:
   - `zfarcrycore/packages/types/` (core entities)
   - `plugins/*/packages/types/` (plugin entities)
3. **Creating accurate entity-plugin mappings** based on actual folder locations
4. **Filtering knownTables** to only include entities that exist in both database and CFC files

This ensures:
- ‚úÖ **Accurate `knownTables`** based on actual database structure
- ‚úÖ **Correct `entityPluginMapping`** based on folder locations (not hardcoded)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic updates** when database or folder structure changes

```powershell
# Generate configuration from database and folder structure
.\generate_cfc_scan_config.ps1
```

### **How the Exclusion System Works**

The tool uses a two-level exclusion system to ensure entities are completely removed from diagram generation:

1. **`excludeFiles`** - Prevents CFC files from being scanned for relationships
2. **`knownTables` filtering** - Removes entities from the database-derived table list

**How it works:**
- The generator script reads the existing `cfc_scan_config.json`
- Extracts the `excludeFiles` array (e.g., `["farFilter.cfc", "farTask.cfc"]`)
- Converts `.cfc` filenames to entity names (e.g., `farFilter.cfc` ‚Üí `farFilter`)
- Filters the `knownTables` array to exclude these entities
- Updates the config with the filtered `knownTables`

**To exclude an entity:**
1. Add the `.cfc` filename to the `excludeFiles` array in `cfc_scan_config.json`
2. Run `.\generate_cfc_scan_config.ps1` to regenerate the config
3. The entity will be excluded from both CFC scanning and `knownTables`

**Example:**
```json
{
  "scanSettings": {
    "excludeFiles": [
      "participant.cfc",
      "module.cfc", 
      "farFilter.cfc",
      "farTask.cfc"
    ]
  }
}
```

This ensures that excluded entities never appear in generated diagrams, even if they exist in the database.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
- **No diagram displayed**: Check the generated `.mmd` file for syntax errors
- **Missing entities**: Verify the entity exists in the specified domains
- **Browser issues**: Try opening the `.html` file manually
- **Test failures**: Run `.\run_all_tests.ps1` to identify specific issues
- **Configuration issues**: Run `.\generate_cfc_scan_config.ps1` to regenerate config

### **Debug Mode:**
```powershell
# Enable debug logging
.\generate_erd_enhanced.ps1 -lFocus "member" -DiagramType "ER" -lDomains "participant" -Debug
.\generate_component_diagram.ps1 -Focus "member" -lDomains "participant,provider" -Debug
```

## üìù **N.B. CFC Documentation Enhancement**

The project includes tools for enhancing ColdFusion Component documentation with comprehensive business context:

### **Process:**
1. **Configuration**: Update `config/component_hints.json` with short descriptions
2. **Scripts**: Use `src/powershell/update_cfc_descriptions.ps1` for bulk updates
3. **Testing**: Use `src/powershell/test_activityDef_update.ps1` for single component testing

### **What Gets Enhanced:**
- **@@Description comments**: Full business context with Business Context, Technical Role, and Key Relationships
- **hint attributes**: Concise, professional descriptions for the `<cfcomponent>` tag

### **Usage:**
```powershell
# Test changes (dry run)
.\update_cfc_descriptions.ps1 -DryRun -Verbose

# Apply changes to all components
.\update_cfc_descriptions.ps1 -DryRun:$false

# Test single component
.\test_activityDef_update.ps1 -DryRun:$false
```

### **Quality Standards:**
- ‚úÖ No quote characters that could break CFC files
- ‚úÖ Consistent terminology (participants, not patients)
- ‚úÖ Business-focused descriptions, not technical jargon
- ‚úÖ Clear relationships explained
- ‚úÖ Professional tone suitable for stakeholders

**This process transforms basic CFC files into comprehensive, self-documenting components that explain the business context to non-FarCry developers!**
