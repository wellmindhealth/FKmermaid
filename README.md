## üåç Domain System

### **How We Organize Components**

The system uses **4 domains** for diagram generation to preserve cross-domain relationships:

#### **`provider`** - Business relationships and organizational structure
- **Core**: partner, referer, intake, center, memberGroup
- **Admin**: farUser, farGroup, farRole, farPermission, dmProfile
- **Programme**: programme, progRole, activityDef, media

#### **`participant`** - User journeys and personal data
- **Core**: member, memberGroup, progMember, activity, programme
- **Tracking**: ssq_stress01, ssq_pain01, ssq_arthritis01, tracker, trackerDef
- **Programme**: progRole, activityDef, media, journal, journalDef, library, guide

#### **`pathway`** - Content structure and flow
- **Core**: programme, progRole, activityDef
- **Content**: media, defaultMediaID, aCuePointActivities, aMediaIDs, guide
- **Flow**: onEndID, aCuePointActivities, aInteract1Activities, etc.


- **Core**: dmNavigation, dmHTML, dmFacts, dmNews, dmInclude
- **Resources**: dmImage, dmFile



**Why 4 domains?** Because real components connect across boundaries. For example, `member` (participant) connects to `partner` (healthcare organization) - these cross-domain relationships are crucial for understanding the complete system.

## üé® **The Oracle of the 5-Tier Color System**

The FKmermaid system uses a sophisticated **5-tier semantic styling system** that creates visual hierarchy based on **domain membership** and **relationship proximity** to the focus entity.

### **üß† The Color Oracle:**

#### **ORANGE** (`#d75500`) - **FOCUS TIER**
- **What**: The primary focus entity(ies) specified in the `-lFocus` parameter
- **Example**: When you focus on "journal", the journal entity gets orange styling
- **Logic**: Direct focus assignment

#### **GOLD** (`#693a00`) - **DOMAIN + DIRECTLY RELATED**
- **What**: Entities that are BOTH in the same domain as focus AND have direct relationships
- **Example**: If journal is in pathway domain, other pathway entities with direct FK relationships to journal get gold
- **Logic**: `Same Domain` + `Direct Relationship` = Gold

#### **BLUE** (`#1963d2`) - **DIRECTLY RELATED BUT DIFFERENT DOMAIN**
- **What**: Entities from other domains that have direct relationships to the focus
- **Example**: If journal is pathway domain, but dmFile (from zfarcrycore) has direct relationship to journal, dmFile gets blue
- **Logic**: `Different Domain` + `Direct Relationship` = Blue

#### **BLUE-GREY** (`#44517f`) - **SAME DOMAIN BUT NOT DIRECTLY RELATED**
- **What**: Entities in the same domain as focus but without direct relationships
- **Example**: Other pathway domain entities that don't directly relate to journal
- **Logic**: `Same Domain` + `No Direct Relationship` = Blue-Grey

#### **DARK GREY** (`#1a1a1a`) - **DEFAULT/OTHERS**
- **What**: All other entities (different domain + no direct relationship)
- **Example**: Entities from other domains with no direct relationships to focus
- **Logic**: `Different Domain` + `No Direct Relationship` = Dark Grey

### **üéØ The Oracle's Wisdom:**

**Proximity Logic**: Colors represent **relationship proximity** to the focus entity:
- **Orange**: You ARE the focus
- **Gold**: You're in the same "family" (domain) AND directly connected
- **Blue**: You're directly connected but from a different "family" 
- **Blue-Grey**: You're in the same "family" but not directly connected
- **Dark Grey**: You're neither in the same family nor directly connected

**Domain + Relationship Matrix**:
```
                    | Direct Relationship | No Direct Relationship
Same Domain         | GOLD              | BLUE-GREY
Different Domain    | BLUE              | DARK GREY
```

This creates a visual hierarchy showing how "close" each entity is to the focus entity in terms of both domain membership and relationship strength!

### **Exclusion System**
Two-level exclusion for complete entity removal:

```json
{
  "scanSettings": {
    "excludeFiles": ["participant.cfc", "module.cfc"],
    "excludeFolders": ["farcrycms", "social", "aws"]
  }
}
```

### **Generating Configuration from Database**

The `generate_cfc_scan_config.ps1` script automatically generates the `cfc_scan_config.json` file by:

1. **Analyzing the database structure** from `config/dbdump.sql`
2. **Scanning folder locations** to find CFC files in:
   - `zfarcrycore/packages/types/` (core entities)
   - `plugins/*/packages/types/` (plugin entities)
3. **Creating accurate entity-plugin mappings** based on actual folder locations
4. **Filtering knownTables** to only include entities that exist in both database and CFC files

This ensures:
- ‚úÖ **Accurate `knownTables`** based on actual database structure
- ‚úÖ **Correct `entityPluginMapping`** based on folder locations (not hardcoded)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic updates** when database or folder structure changes

```powershell
# Generate configuration from database and folder structure
.\generate_cfc_scan_config.ps1
```

### **How the Exclusion System Works**

The tool uses a two-level exclusion system to ensure entities are completely removed from diagram generation:

1. **`excludeFiles`** - Prevents CFC files from being scanned for relationships
2. **`knownTables` filtering** - Removes entities from the database-derived table list

**How it works:**
- The generator script reads the existing `cfc_scan_config.json`
- Extracts the `excludeFiles` array (e.g., `["farFilter.cfc", "farTask.cfc"]`)
- Converts `.cfc` filenames to entity names (e.g., `farFilter.cfc` ‚Üí `farFilter`)
- Filters the `knownTables` array to exclude these entities
- Updates the config with the filtered `knownTables`

**To exclude an entity:**
1. Add the `.cfc` filename to the `excludeFiles` array in `cfc_scan_config.json`
2. Run `.\generate_cfc_scan_config.ps1` to regenerate the config
3. The entity will be excluded from both CFC scanning and `knownTables`

**Example:**
```json
{
  "scanSettings": {
    "excludeFiles": [
      "participant.cfc",
      "module.cfc", 
      "farFilter.cfc",
      "farTask.cfc"
    ]
  }
}
```

This ensures that excluded entities never appear in generated diagrams, even if they exist in the database.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
- **No diagram displayed**: Check the generated `.mmd` file for syntax errors
- **Missing entities**: Verify the entity exists in the specified domains
- **Browser issues**: Try opening the `.html` file manually
- **Test failures**: Run `.\run_all_tests.ps1` to identify specific issues
- **Configuration issues**: Run `.\generate_cfc_scan_config.ps1` to regenerate config

### **Debug Mode:**
```powershell
# Enable debug logging
.\generate_erd_enhanced.ps1 -lFocus "member" -DiagramType "ER" -lDomains "participant" -Debug
.\generate_component_diagram.ps1 -Focus "member" -lDomains "participant,provider" -Debug
```

## üîß **Unified CFC Cache System**

The project uses a unified cache generation system to ensure all scripts work with the same component metadata:

### **Primary Cache Generator:**
- **`generate_cfc_cache.ps1`** - The main cache generation script
  - Creates rich `componentMetadata` with `displayName`, `hint`, `description`, `faIcon`
  - Extracts full property details with `ftType`, `ftLabel`, `hint`
  - Preserves existing `cfc_cache.json` structure for backward compatibility
  - Used by all diagram generation scripts and the dev.html interface

### **Configuration Generator:**
- **`generate_cfc_scan_config.ps1`** - Creates the scan configuration (database-based)
  - Analyzes database structure from `config/dbdump.sql` (SQL Server schema dump)
  - Maps entities to plugins based on folder locations
  - Creates `cfc_scan_config.json` with `knownTables` and `entityPluginMapping`
  - **When to use**: After database changes or when adding new plugins
  - **Source**: `config/dbdump.sql` contains SQL Server CREATE TABLE statements for `farcrybemindfulonline_new` database

- **`generate_cfc_scan_config.ps1`** - Creates the scan configuration (CFC-based)
  - Analyzes CFC files to extract table names and entity mappings
  - No database dependency - completely self-contained
  - Creates `cfc_scan_config.json` with `knownTables` and `entityPluginMapping`
  - **When to use**: When CFCs change or when you want to eliminate database dependency
  - **Source**: CFC files with `@tableName`, `tableName` property, or filename-based extraction
  - **Exclusions**: Uses centralized `config/exclusions.json` for consistent filtering

## üìã **Centralized Configuration:**

### **Configuration "Oracle":**
- **`config/cfc_scan_config.json`** - The central "oracle" of known tables and relationships
  - **Purpose**: Defines which CFCs are scanned and how they're categorized
  - **Source**: Generated from CFC analysis (not manually edited)
  - **Contains**: `knownTables`, `entityPluginMapping`, scan settings
  - **Usage**: All scripts reference this as the authoritative source

### **Exclusions Management:**
- **`config/exclusions.json`** - Centralized exclusions configuration (MANUALLY EDITABLE)
  - `excludeFiles`: CFC files to exclude from scanning
  - `excludeFolders`: Plugin folders to exclude
  - `workspaceFolders`: Active workspace folders
  - **Benefits**: Single source of truth, no hardcoded exclusions
  - **Note**: Edit this file to change exclusions, NOT `cfc_scan_config.json`

### **Usage:**
```powershell
# Generate configuration from database structure
.\generate_cfc_scan_config.ps1

# Generate unified CFC cache
.\generate_cfc_cache.ps1

# All other scripts will use the same cache file
.\generate_erd_enhanced.ps1 -lFocus "member" -DiagramType "ER" -lDomains "participant"
.\generate_component_diagram.ps1 -Focus "member" -lDomains "participant,provider"
```

## üîÑ **Workflow for Changes**

### **When CFCs or domains.json changes:**
```powershell
# Option 1: Regenerate everything with fresh cache (RECOMMENDED)
.\generate_all_cfc_diagrams.ps1 -RefreshCFCs

# Option 2: Manual cache refresh first
.\generate_cfc_cache.ps1
.\generate_all_cfc_diagrams.ps1
```

### **For dev.html interface:**
- Always run cache refresh before opening dev.html after changes
- dev.html reads from `config/cfc_cache.json`
- Smart detection checks cache timestamps vs CFC files

## üìã **Change Impact Analysis:**

### **When CFCs change:**
- **Need**: `generate_cfc_cache.ps1` (updates component metadata)
- **Need**: `generate_cfc_scan_config_from_cfcs.ps1` (updates table mappings - CFC-based)
- **Need**: `generate_all_cfc_diagrams.ps1` (regenerates all diagrams)
- **Need**: `generate_baselines.ps1` (updates test expectations)
- **Workflow**: 
  ```powershell
  .\src\powershell\generate_cfc_scan_config_from_cfcs.ps1
  .\generate_all_cfc_diagrams.ps1 -RefreshCFCs
  .\tests\baseline_tests\generate_baselines.ps1 -Force
  .\tests\update_test_expectations.ps1
  .\tests\run_all_tests.ps1
  ```

### **When domains.json changes:**
- **Need**: `generate_all_cfc_diagrams.ps1` (regenerates all diagrams)
- **Need**: `generate_baselines.ps1` (updates test expectations - domains affect diagram content)
- **Don't need**: `generate_cfc_cache.ps1` (CFC metadata unchanged)
- **Workflow**: 
  ```powershell
  .\generate_all_cfc_diagrams.ps1 -RefreshCFCs
  .\tests\baseline_tests\generate_baselines.ps1 -Force
  .\tests\run_all_tests.ps1
  ```

### **Cache Generation Details:**
- **`generate_cfc_cache.ps1`** generates ALL sections of the cache on every run:
  - `componentMetadata` (component info, hints, descriptions)
  - `directFK` (foreign key relationships)
  - `joinTables` (many-to-many relationships)
  - `entities` (entity definitions)
  - `properties` (property details)
- **Full regeneration**: Always regenerates complete cache structure
- **Backward compatible**: Preserves existing cache format

## üîÑ **Complete Workflow Consolidation:**

### **Development Workflow:**
```powershell
# 1. Quick testing (6 diagrams)
.\generate_all_cfc_diagrams_test.ps1 -RefreshCFCs

# 2. Full generation (dynamic diagrams based on domains.json)
.\generate_all_cfc_diagrams.ps1 -RefreshCFCs

# 3. Update test baselines
.\tests\baseline_tests\generate_baselines.ps1 -Force

# 4. Run test suite
.\tests\run_all_tests.ps1
```

### **File Management:**
- **`all_diagrams_results.json`**: Full diagrams (production)
- **`all_diagrams_results_test.json`**: 6 test diagrams (development)
- **Cleanup**: Remove old `165_diagrams_results.json` after migration

## üß™ **Testing Workflow:**

### **Quick Testing:**
```powershell
# Generate 6 test diagrams (3 CFCs √ó 2 domains) for quick testing
.\tests\generate_all_cfc_diagrams_test.ps1 -RefreshCFCs

# Run comprehensive test suite
.\tests\run_all_tests.ps1
```

### **Baseline Regeneration (After CFC or domains.json Changes):**
```powershell
# 1. Regenerate all test baselines
.\tests\baseline_tests\generate_baselines.ps1 -Force

# 2. Update test expectations with new entity counts
# (Manual step: Update ExpectedEntityCount values in test_edge_cases.ps1)

# 3. Run tests to verify baselines are correct
.\tests\run_all_tests.ps1
```

### **When to Regenerate Baselines:**
- **After CFC changes**: Component metadata, relationships, or properties change
- **After domains.json changes**: Domain definitions or entity mappings change (CRITICAL - affects diagram content)
- **After styling changes**: Diagram appearance or formatting changes
- **Before major releases**: Ensure all tests pass with current codebase

### **Test Expectation Updates:**
After baseline regeneration, automatically update `ExpectedEntityCount` values:
```powershell
# Automated update of test expectations
.\tests\update_test_expectations.ps1
```

This script analyzes generated baseline files and updates:
- `tests/baseline_tests/test_edge_cases.ps1` (26 edge case tests)
- `tests/main_script_tests/test_5_tier_system.ps1` (5-tier styling tests)
- `tests/main_script_tests/test_manual_verification.ps1` (manual verification tests)

**Note**: The `update_test_expectations.ps1` script is automatically called by `generate_baselines.ps1` after baseline generation.

### **Test Coverage:**
- **26 edge case baselines**: Comprehensive validation of diagram generation
- **5-tier semantic styling**: Visual consistency and hierarchy testing
- **Domain detection**: Filtering and relationship accuracy
- **Manual verification**: Output quality and completeness checks

      "filePath": "/farcry/plugins/api/packages/types/apiAccessKey.cfc"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìù **N.B. CFC Documentation Enhancement**

The project includes tools for enhancing ColdFusion Component documentation with comprehensive business context:

### **Process:**
1. **Configuration**: Update `config/component_hints.json` with short descriptions
2. **Scripts**: Use `src/powershell/update_cfc_descriptions.ps1` for bulk updates
3. **Testing**: Use `src/powershell/test_activityDef_update.ps1` for single component testing

### **What Gets Enhanced:**
- **@@Description comments**: Full business context with Business Context, Technical Role, and Key Relationships
- **hint attributes**: Concise, professional descriptions for the `<cfcomponent>` tag

### **Usage:**
```powershell
# Test changes (dry run)
.\update_cfc_descriptions.ps1 -DryRun -Verbose

# Apply changes to all components
.\update_cfc_descriptions.ps1 -DryRun:$false

# Test single component
.\test_activityDef_update.ps1 -DryRun:$false
```

### **Quality Standards:**
- ‚úÖ No quote characters that could break CFC files
- ‚úÖ Consistent terminology (participants, not patients)
- ‚úÖ Business-focused descriptions, not technical jargon
- ‚úÖ Clear relationships explained
- ‚úÖ Professional tone suitable for stakeholders

**This process transforms basic CFC files into comprehensive, self-documenting components that explain the business context to non-FarCry developers!**

## üé® **The Oracle of the 5-Tier Color System**

The FKmermaid system uses a sophisticated **5-tier semantic styling system** that creates visual hierarchy based on **domain membership** and **relationship proximity** to the focus entity.

### **üß† The Color Oracle:**

#### **ORANGE** (`#d75500`) - **FOCUS TIER**
- **What**: The primary focus entity(ies) specified in the `-lFocus` parameter
- **Example**: When you focus on "journal", the journal entity gets orange styling
- **Logic**: Direct focus assignment

#### **RUST** (`#9d3100`) - **DOMAIN + DIRECTLY RELATED**
- **What**: Entities that are BOTH in the same domain as focus AND have direct relationships
- **Example**: If journal is in pathway domain, other pathway entities with direct FK relationships to journal get rust
- **Logic**: `Same Domain` + `Direct Relationship` = Rust

#### **MAGENTA** (`#883583`) - **DIRECTLY RELATED BUT DIFFERENT DOMAIN**
- **What**: Entities from other domains that have direct relationships to the focus
- **Example**: If journal is pathway domain, but dmFile (from zfarcrycore) has direct relationship to journal, dmFile gets magenta
- **Logic**: `Different Domain` + `Direct Relationship` = Magenta

#### **COFFEE** (`#7e4f2b`) - **SAME DOMAIN BUT NOT DIRECTLY RELATED**
- **What**: Entities in the same domain as focus but without direct relationships
- **Example**: Other pathway domain entities that don't directly relate to journal
- **Logic**: `Same Domain` + `No Direct Relationship` = Coffee

#### **DARK GREY** (`#1a1a1a`) - **DEFAULT/OTHERS**
- **What**: All other entities (different domain + no direct relationship)
- **Example**: Entities from other domains with no direct relationships to focus
- **Logic**: `Different Domain` + `No Direct Relationship` = Dark Grey

### **üéØ The Oracle's Wisdom:**

**Proximity Logic**: Colors represent **relationship proximity** to the focus entity:
- **Orange**: You ARE the focus
- **Rust**: You're in the same "family" (domain) AND directly connected
- **Magenta**: You're directly connected but from a different "family" 
- **Coffee**: You're in the same "family" but not directly connected
- **Dark Grey**: You're neither in the same family nor directly connected

**Domain + Relationship Matrix**:
```
                                | Direct Relationship | No Direct Relationship
Same Domain                     | RUST              | COFFEE
Different Domain                | MAGENTA           | DARK GREY
```

This creates a visual hierarchy showing how "close" each entity is to the focus entity in terms of both domain membership and relationship strength!
